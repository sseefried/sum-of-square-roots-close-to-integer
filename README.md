# Sum of two square roots (of non perfect squares) close to integer

This program will find pairs of numbers that are non-perfect square numbers that
sum to a value very close to an integer.

It sorts the results by how close they are to an integer.

The best result for integers below 10000 is 6618 and 9670.
The sum of the square roots is 176.99999990870472.

A non-perfect square number is one that, for integer m there is no integer
n such that m = n*n.
